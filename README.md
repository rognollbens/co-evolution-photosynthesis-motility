# Co-evolution of Photosynthetic Structures and Muscle-like Proteins

## Abstract
This research project investigates the hypothetical evolutionary pathway where a disc-like photosynthetic structure becomes dependent on muscle-like protein fibers for its function. The central question is: "How might the evolution of muscle-like protein fibers and light-capturing disc structures become interdependent?" We explore the co-evolutionary dynamics between motility systems and photosynthetic organelles, considering selective pressures, molecular mechanisms, and potential transitional forms.
